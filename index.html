            The name is Mina Hanna born and raised in the United States on June 12th 1991. I have tons of hobbies one being that I love to play Golf as it helps me to relax and let out any stress I may have. During my teenage years I have grown a passion for cars, I enjoyed racing cars as well as drifitng. My fastest car I have owned was a 2005 Legacy GT Limitied Turbo running over 310hp, this was my street racing vehical. During my free time I enjoy detailing cars while during my downtime or usually during weekends I detail customer cars as a side job I have going on. I currently still live with my parents and my older sister. As of June 2017 we welcomed are pet Romeo who is turning 2 this upcoming June.
